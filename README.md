About Data
This report is based on a dataset consisting of information about breast cancer diagnoses. The dataset contains 33 columns and 569 rows, with each row representing a patient and each column representing a different feature of the patient's diagnosis. The first column contains a unique identifier for each patient, while the second column contains information about whether the patient's diagnosis was malignant (M) or benign (B).

The following columns contain numerical data about various physical characteristics of the tumor, such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, smoothness_mean, compactness_mean, concavity_mean, concave points_mean, and so on. These features are calculated from images of the tumor that were taken using digital mammography.

The last column, Unnamed: 32, is empty and does not contain any data. It can be dropped from the dataset.

Project Report:

The objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and build a machine learning model to predict whether a breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign based on the physical characteristics of the tumor.

Data Description:

The dataset contains the following columns:

id: A unique identifier for each patient
diagnosis: Whether the diagnosis is malignant (M) or benign (B)
radius_mean: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
texture_mean: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
perimeter_mean: Perimeter of the tumor
area_mean: Area of the tumor
smoothness_mean: Local variation in radius lengths
compactness_mean: Perimeter^2 / area - 1.0
concavity_mean: Severity of concave portions of the contour
concave points_mean: Number of concave portions of the contour
symmetry_mean: Symmetry of tumor
fractal_dimension_mean: "Coastline approximation" - 1
radius_se: Standard error of mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
texture_se: Standard error of gray-scale values
perimeter_se: Standard error of perimeter
